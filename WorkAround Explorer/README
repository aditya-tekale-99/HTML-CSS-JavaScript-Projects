WorkAround is a research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry. 
Open up salaryData.js in modules to see the data they have collected. 
Created a few functions for filtering data to get subsets of data by role and by company.

WorkAround now wants to release a new web application called WorkAround Explorer to make their data more easily viewable. 
This web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

1) The salary for the chosen role at the chosen company.
2) The industry average for the chosen role.
3) The average salary at the chosen company across all roles.
4) The industry average salary across all roles and all companies.

Much of the user interface has already been designed by front-end developers, however, the core data and functionality are either missing or
need to be connected together using modules. 

My task is to help out by using my import and export expertise in JavaScript!
